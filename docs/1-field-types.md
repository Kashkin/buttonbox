# Field Types

There are currently five field types.

## Buttons

Make a button group with optional labels and icons. We've provided you with a set of icons for common use cases but any image can be used. Icons work best when they are 30 x 20px or less.

## Colours and Text Size

Add pixel sizes or css colours to your options and see them in an alternative dropdown ui.

## Stars

Provide a number of stars in the field settings and thats it!

## Width

Give users a UI that makes sense for setting the width of something. This works best when used to select a number of columns in a predefined grid.
